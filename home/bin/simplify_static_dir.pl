=head1 NAME

simplify_static_dir - optimize directories for size by combinining identical
files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<simplify_static_dir> [I<OPTIONS>] [I<DIR>]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The more files this script can process at once, the better. It maintains an
internal hash of files indexed by their SHA1 checksum. When it finds a
collision it removes the file with the least amount of file system links, then
creates a hard link to the other in its place. The larger the number of files
scanned, the more likely it is that there will be collisions.

There are failsafes in place, though. If somehow two files' SHA1 checksums are
identical, but the file sizes do not match, this program will error out (and
you can go ahead and report the collision; it may be worth money).

There are other features built in as well. Following the logic that unique
data, once created has the attribute of being unique of that point in time,
this script will copy the timestamp of the older file onto the newer file just
before it makes the hard link. Therefore, many times, simplified directories
will have the appearance of being older than they actually are.

From the perspective of any program reading files from the simplified
directoriws, the files will lookB<*> and behave the same way as the initial
state.

B<*> Except for having an increased number of hard links.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-v>

Verbose output.

=item B<-f>

Print a sum of the number of freed bytes.

=item B<-m> I<REGEX>

Only match file paths matching I<REGEX>.

=item B<-M> I<REGEX>

Exclude file paths matching I<REGEX>.

=item B<-s>

Generate symlinks only.

=item B<-S>

Do not generate ANY symlinks.

=item B<-z>

Include zero-length files in search. Normally they are ignored (you don't save
diskspace by hard-linking empty files).

=item B<--help>

Output this help message and exit.

=item B<--version>

Output version information and exit.

=back

By default, scans the current directory. Files not able to be hard-linked are
symlinked by default.

=head1 CHANGES

=over

=item 1.1.0

Outputs GNU-style messages (ala `rm -v,' `ln -v,' etc.).

=item 1.1.1

Added B<-m> and B<-M> options.

=item 1.1.2

Added B<-z> option. Now the default behavior is to not process empty files.
Because what's the point of freeing up no space?

=item 1.2.0

Uses L<Digest::SHA> instead of L<Digest::MD5>. MD5 has been broken.

=item 1.2.1

Fixed bug when processing files with \r characters in the name.
